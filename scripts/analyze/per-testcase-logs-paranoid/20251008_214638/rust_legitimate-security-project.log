  SHAI-HULUD + PARANOID SECURITY REPORT
==============================================

⚠️  MEDIUM RISK: Potentially suspicious secret scanning patterns:
   - Pattern: Contains trufflehog references in source code
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/legitimate-security-project/security-scanner.py
   - Pattern: Contains credential scanning patterns
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/legitimate-security-project/security-scanner.py
   - Pattern: Potentially suspicious environment variable access
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/legitimate-security-project/security-scanner.py
   NOTE: These may be legitimate security tools or framework code.
   Manual review recommended to determine if they are malicious.

==============================================
🔍 SUMMARY:
   High Risk Issues: 0
   Medium Risk Issues: 3
   Total Critical Issues: 3

⚠️  IMPORTANT:
   - High risk issues likely indicate actual compromise
   - Medium risk issues require manual investigation
   - Low risk issues are likely false positives from legitimate code
   - Issues marked (PARANOID) are general security checks, not Shai-Hulud specific
   - Consider running additional security scans
   - Review your npm audit logs and package history
