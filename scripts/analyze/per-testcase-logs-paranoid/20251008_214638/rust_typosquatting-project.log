==============================================
🔍 SUMMARY:
   High Risk Issues: 0
   Medium Risk Issues: 3
   Total Critical Issues: 3

⚠️  IMPORTANT:
   - High risk issues likely indicate actual compromise
   - Medium risk issues require manual investigation
   - Low risk issues are likely false positives from legitimate code
   - Issues marked (PARANOID) are general security checks, not Shai-Hulud specific
   - Consider running additional security scans
   - Review your npm audit logs and package history
