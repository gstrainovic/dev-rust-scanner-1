      SHAI-HULUD DETECTION REPORT
==============================================

🚨 HIGH RISK: Compromised package versions detected:
   - Package: chalk@5.6.1
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/lockfile-comprehensive-test/package.json
   [34m┌─ File: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/lockfile-comprehensive-test/package.json[0m
   [34m│  Context: HIGH RISK: Contains compromised package version: chalk@5.6.1[0m
   [34m└─[0m

   NOTE: These specific package versions are known to be compromised.
   You should immediately update or remove these packages.

ℹ️  LOW RISK: Packages with safe lockfile versions:
   - Package: debug@^4.0.1 (locked to 4.0.1 - safe)
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/lockfile-comprehensive-test/package.json
   - Package: error-ex@^1.2.0 (locked to 1.2.0 - safe)
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/lockfile-comprehensive-test/package.json
   NOTE: These package.json ranges could match compromised versions, but lockfiles pin to safe versions.
   Your current installation is safe. Avoid running 'npm update' without reviewing changes.

⚠️  MEDIUM RISK: Package integrity issues detected:
   - Issue: Compromised package in lockfile: chalk@5.6.1
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/lockfile-comprehensive-test/package-lock.json
   NOTE: These issues may indicate tampering with package dependencies.

==============================================
🔍 SUMMARY:
   High Risk Issues: 1
   Medium Risk Issues: 1
   Total Critical Issues: 2

⚠️  IMPORTANT:
   - High risk issues likely indicate actual compromise
   - Medium risk issues require manual investigation
   - Low risk issues are likely false positives from legitimate code
   - Consider running additional security scans
   - Review your npm audit logs and package history
