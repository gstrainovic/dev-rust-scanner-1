# Verification Scripts

## verify_sorted_findings.sh - THE Verification Script ⭐

**Purpose**: Verify 100% identical output between Bash and Rust scanners (order-independent)

**What it verifies**:
1. ✅ **Summary Block** - High/Medium/Low risk counts
2. ✅ **All Findings** - Every package, pattern, activity detected (62 total)

**Features**:
- Order-independent comparison (findings can be in any order)
- Strips ANSI color codes for accurate comparison
- Uses existing logs (fast - no re-run needed)
- Clear pass/fail output

**Usage**:
```bash
cd /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner
bash dev-rust-scanner-1/scripts/verification/verify_sorted_findings.sh
```

**Expected Output**:
```
🔍 COMPLETE VERIFICATION - Summary + Findings
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 Step 1: Verifying Summary Block...
   ✅ Summary block matches!

📊 Step 2: Verifying All Findings (Order-Independent)...
   Bash findings: 62
   Rust findings: 62

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎉 100% VERIFICATION PASSED!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Summary:  Identical (19 HIGH / 61 MEDIUM / 9 LOW)
✅ Findings: 62 (all identical, order-independent)
```

**Requirements**:
- Bash log: `shai-hulud-detect/bash-testcases.log`
- Rust log: `dev-rust-scanner-1/logs/rust-testcases-new.log`

**Note**: This is the ONLY verification script you need. All other verification scripts have been removed as they were either too slow, too complex, or provided less comprehensive verification.
