## ÔøΩüìã QUICK REFERENCE

### Daily Development
```bash
# Quick check both modes
bash scripts/verification/final_both_modes_check.sh

# Quick paranoid check
bash scripts/verification/quick_paranoid_check.sh
```

### Before Release
```bash
# Full verification (normal + paranoid modes, all 26 test cases)
bash scripts/analyze/verify_100_percent.sh
bash scripts/analyze/verify_100_percent_paranoid.sh

# OR: Run parallel scans first, then verify
bash scripts/analyze/parallel_testcase_scan.sh
bash scripts/analyze/verify_100_percent.sh
```

### Investigating Issues
```bash
# Find which case differs
bash scripts/debug/find_high_diff.sh

# Analyze counting method
bash scripts/analysis/exact_bash_high_count.sh
bash scripts/analysis/exact_rust_high_breakdown.sh
```

### Understanding Differences
```bash
# Compare methodologies
bash scripts/analysis/compare_high_counts.sh

# Debug specific detection
bash scripts/debug/debug_rust_compromised.sh
```

## üéØ RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

1. **During Development**: Use `quick_paranoid_check.sh` for fast feedback
2. **Before Commit**: Run `final_both_modes_check.sh` 
3. **Before Release**: Run `verify_100_percent.sh` and `verify_100_percent_paranoid.sh`
4. **When Debugging**: Use debug/ and analysis/ scripts as needed
