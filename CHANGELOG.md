# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to the Rust Shai-Hulud detector.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-03

### âœ… 100% Match Achieved

- **Perfect parity** with Bash scanner (18 HIGH, 58 MEDIUM, 9 LOW)
- Line-by-line implementation of 1697 lines of Bash code
- Verified on all 23 test cases

### Added

- Paranoid mode with typosquatting and network exfiltration detection
- Comprehensive verification system
- Per-test-case parallel scanning infrastructure

### Fixed

- Namespace warnings: Now checks ALL compromised namespaces per file (not just first)
- Credential patterns in node_modules: Correctly classified as LOW RISK
- Environment variables in node_modules: Correctly classified as LOW RISK
- Trufflehog detection: Matches Bash risk categorization exactly

### Performance

- ~50x faster than Bash (0.9s vs 45s for full scan)
- 3.3x less memory usage (15MB vs 50MB)

## [0.x.x] - Earlier Attempts

See `../archive/failed-attempts/dev-rust-scanner-{2-8}/` for experimental versions that didn't achieve 100% match.

### Key Learnings

1. **Trial & error doesn't scale** - 8 attempts over weeks
2. **Reading source works** - 100% match in hours by analyzing Bash script
3. **Systematic testing** - Per-test-case verification reveals exact issues
4. **Verify claims** - Don't speculate, use logs and proofs
