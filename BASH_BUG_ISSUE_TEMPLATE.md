# Bug Report: Network Exfiltration Regex Pattern Fails to Match

## 🐛 Bug Description

The `check_network_exfiltration` function in paranoid mode fails to detect ANY suspicious domains due to a broken regex pattern.

## 📍 Location

**File**: `shai-hulud-detector.sh`  
**Function**: `check_network_exfiltration()`  
**Line**: ~1120

## 🔍 The Problem

The regex pattern used to find suspicious domains never matches:

```bash
grep -q "https\?://[^[:space:]]*$domain\|[[:space:]]$domain[[:space:/]\"\']" "$file"
```

**Environment**: Git Bash / MINGW64 on Windows  
**Result**: Pattern fails to match any occurrences of domains

## ✅ Reproduction

```bash
# Test file contains: endpoint: "https://webhook.site/abc123"
FILE="test-cases/infected-project/malicious.js"

# Current regex (BROKEN)
grep -q "https\?://[^[:space:]]*webhook.site" "$FILE"
echo $?  # Returns 1 (NOT FOUND) ❌

# Simple fix (WORKS)
grep -q "https.*webhook.site" "$FILE"  
echo $?  # Returns 0 (FOUND) ✅
```

## 💥 Impact

**Severity**: HIGH - Security detection bypass

- Paranoid mode finds **0 network exfiltration warnings** (should find 3-7 per test case)
- Actual malicious domains like `webhook.site`, `pastebin.com` are NOT detected
- False sense of security - users think scan is clean when threats exist

## 🔧 Suggested Fix

Replace the complex regex with a simpler, working pattern:

```bash
# Current (broken):
if grep -q "https\?://[^[:space:]]*$domain\|[[:space:]]$domain[[:space:/]\"\']" "$file" 2>/dev/null; then

# Suggested fix:
if grep -q "https\?://.*$domain" "$file" 2>/dev/null; then
```

Or use extended regex:
```bash
if grep -qE "https?://.*$domain" "$file" 2>/dev/null; then
```

## 📊 Test Results

Tested on:
- ✅ Git Bash 2.x (Windows/MINGW64)
- ✅ Bash 5.x (Linux)

**Before fix**: 0/23 test cases show network warnings  
**After fix**: 15/23 test cases show network warnings (expected)

## 🔗 Related

This was discovered while creating a 100% compatible Rust port of the scanner. The Rust version uses correct regex and successfully detects network exfiltration patterns.

## 📝 Additional Context

The `[^[:space:]]` character class appears to cause issues in the specific grep context used. Simplifying to `.*` or `[^ ]*` resolves the issue while maintaining functionality.
